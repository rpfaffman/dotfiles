; Chapter Five Questions

; 1) You used (comp :intelligence :attributes) to create a function that returns a characterâ€™s intelligence. Create a new function, attr, that you can call like (attr :intelligence) and that does the same thing.

(def character
  {:name "Smooches McCutes"
   :attributes {:intelligence 10
                :strength 4
                :dexterity 5}})

((comp :intelligence :attributes) character)

(defn attr
  [attribute]
  ((comp attribute :attributes) character))

(attr :intelligence)
(attr :strength)

; 2) Implement the comp function.

(defn my-comp
  [& fns]
  )

Yea, it's a very introspective book. I remember there being a lot to think about... I'd have to set the book down after every page to process it all. Also had a notepad handy to write down notes. I should reread it.

I checked out Complications on Amazon, and ended up ordering it along with two other books, haha! Definitely felt the guilt that the article talks about it. I guess you and I are both afflicted with tsundoku. I love the quote towards the end by Winterson - "Those who do it must do it."

Absolutely no need to apologize! It's been awhile since we checked it; I was curious to see how you'd been. Sounds like things are going well. Are you, by the way, following the political debates?
